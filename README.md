# FinanceDashboard
Eager to dive into a real-world project, I turned one of my friends into my very own client and crafted a financial dashboard that met all his needs. He needed a streamlined and efficient way to track his finances over multiple years
He wanted a solution that would provide a clear breakdown of his income, expenses, and savings. The key requirements included the ability to filter data by year, visualize trends over time, and get detailed insights into various expense categories such as EMIs, groceries, health, house rent, and leisure.
In response to these requirements, I developed a comprehensive and interactive financial dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that showcases income, expenses, and savings over multiple years. It features interactive yearly filters, allowing users to easily switch between different time periods.

The dashboard includes dynamic pie charts that break down expenses and savings into specific categories, offering detailed insights at a glance. A trend analysis line chart tracks expense patterns against savings targets, highlighting key financial metrics like total income, total expenses, and savings percentage.The design is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on various devices, including a dedicated mobile layout for seamless on-the-go access.
